# Codex Red Team Opt-In Mode

[English](./README.md)

> Defaults to normal; only enters red-team mode when explicitly enabled.

This is a lightweight, pack-first red team runtime/configuration layer for Codex.

Its goal is not to turn Codex into an automated attack platform.

## Project Description

- This repository is a **general GitHub repository**

- It should not contain personal local paths, private target data, or user-specific tool preferences.

- Documentation descriptions must be consistent with the current actual runtime behavior and cannot be written as "what is planned".

## Why Do This Project?

Many "persistent red team hints" ultimately lead to two bad outcomes:

1. **Pollution of normal operations**

2. **Overly heavy injection, leading to context bloat**

This project does the opposite:

- **Normal mode remains normal**

**Red team mode must be explicitly enabled**

**Hooks remain lightweight**

**Routes remain layered and restrained**

## Core Features

- opt-in Red Team Mode

- `normal` / `redteam-light` / `redteam-full`

- Structured JSON runtime state

- Rule-first + semantic fallback phase detection

- Session isolated state file

- Lightweight prompt overlay

- Pack-first Main Routing Line:

```text
phase -> router -> pack -> leaf

```
## Coverage Scenarios

Core Phase:

- web

- ad

- postex

- reverse

- code-audit

- payload

- evasion

Extended Router/Pack Family:

- recon

- api

- auth

- injection

- file

- business logic

- cloud

- container/kubernetes

- network/protocol

- crypto

- mobile
## Installation

The installer uses **managed incremental installation**:

- Preserves the user's original `AGENTS.md`

- Preserves the user's original `hooks.json`

- Injects only managed blocks from this repository

- Deletes old version runtime remnants from this repository

- Cleanly installs the current version

- Writes to the install manifest

- Automatically executes validate after installation

### Python

```bash
python scripts/install.py

```
### Windows

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1

```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python3 scripts/install.py

```

## Quick Start

### Enable Red Team Mode

```text Enter Red Team Mode
Enable Red Team Mode

/redteam on

/redteam light

/redteam full
enable red team mode

```
### Disable Red Team Mode

```text Exit Red Team Mode
Disable Red Team Mode

/redteam off
disable red team mode

```
### Verify Installation

```bash
python scripts/validate.py

```
## Working Flow

### Runtime Mainline

The current actual routing mainline is:

```text
phase -> router -> pack -> leaf

```
`method` It still exists, but is only used as a soft tip when it is genuinely helpful; it is no longer the main routing axis.

### Mode Description

| Mode | Default | Typical Use |

|---|---:|---|

| `normal` | Yes | Coding, documentation, general research |

| `redteam-light` | No | Targeted security analysis, planning, review |

| `redteam-full` | No | More constrained red team workflow |

## Validation

The repository includes:

- Installer check

- Routing test

- Mode switching test

- Orchestration gate check

- Prompt-chain check

Executable:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"

python scripts/validate.py

```

## Known Limitations

- This is the control/configuration layer, not a complete attack platform

- The actual effect of the prompt overlay still depends on the target Codex environment

- The user's local private prompt system may differ from the repository version

- The actual execution depth still depends on your MCP/ Tools
